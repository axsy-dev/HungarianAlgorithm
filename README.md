# HungarianAlgorithm

This package contains an efficient implementation of the Hungarian Algorithm (otherwise known as the Munkres Assignment Algorithm), which is the optimal 
method to compute the solution to the two-dimensional rectangular assignment problem. For more information about the history and use of the algorithm, see
[this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_algorithm).

In recent years, the Hungarian Algorithm has been used in deep learning methods such as [DETR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12872) and has a 
widely-used implementation in the `scipy.optimize` library (`linear_sum_assignment`). However, to date, no fast implementation of the method exists
in Swift, despite the growing use of machine learning in IOS mobile applications. This package is an attempt to remedy that.
